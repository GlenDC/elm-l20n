# elm-l20n

_elm-l20n_ is an [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) module wrapping around [l20n/l20n.js](https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js). It provides a tiny, but simple API that allows you to add your _l20n manifest file_ to your HTML document and create _identifier_ and _arguments_ attributes.

## Examples

Examples can be found in the `examples/` directory. It's an adaptation of the l20n demo that can be found [here](https://github.com/l20n/demo).
